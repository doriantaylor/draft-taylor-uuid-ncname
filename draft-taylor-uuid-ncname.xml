    <abstract>
      <t>At 122 bits of entropy, the Universally Unique Identifier is a suitable standard for, as the name suggests, uniquely identifying entities in a space large enough that the identifiers do not collide. The literal representation, however, specified in RFC 4122, cannot be used in conjunction with a number of formal grammars where it would be beneficial to do so. This document provides the UUID with two additional isomorphic representations to make these applications possible.</t>
