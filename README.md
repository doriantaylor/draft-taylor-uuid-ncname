# Finally doing it

Writing an I-D for my NCName-friendly UUID representations, implemented in

* [Data::UUID::NCName](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::UUID::NCName) ([p5-data-uuid-ncname](/doriantaylor/p5-data-uuid-ncname)), and
* [UUID::NCName](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/uuid-ncname/) ([rb-uuid-ncname](/doriantaylor/rb-uuid-ncname)).

Also this is an opportunity to learn the ropes of the IETF process, something [I](https://doriantaylor.com/) have put off for quite some time.
